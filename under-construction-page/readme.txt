== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

For anyone who wants to display a under construction / maintenance page while they're doing work on their site.

= What changes will it make to my site? =

None. Once you disable the under construction mode your site will function as it did before.

= How can I work on my site while under construction mode is enabled? =

Make sure your user role (probably admin) is selected under _Access - Whitelisted User Roles_ option and open the site while logged in.

= How can I log in / access WordPress admin after under construction mode has been enabled? =

Enable the _Login Button_ option (found in Content tab), and a login link will be shown in the lower right corner of the WP Dev Helper - under construction.

= How do I add my logo to the page? =

Head over to the _Content_ tab and click "Add Media". Upload/select the logo, position it as you see fit and add other content.

= I've made changes to UCP, but they are not visible. What do I do? =

Click "Save Changes" one more time. Open your site and force refresh browser cache (Ctrl or Shift + F5). If that doesn't help it means you have a caching plugin installed. Purge/delete cache in that plugin or disable it.

= How can I edit designs? =

There is an option to add custom CSS. If you want more than that you will have to edit the source files located in _/under-construction-page/themes/_.

= I have disabled UCP but the WP Dev Helper - under construction is still visible. How do I remove it? =

Open your site and force refresh browser cache (Ctrl or Shift + F5). If that doesn't help it means you have a caching plugin installed. Purge/delete cache in that plugin or disable it. If that fails too contact your hosting provider and ask them to empty the site cache for you.

= Is UCP compatible with caching plugins? =

UCP is compatible with all caching plugins. However, please note that we automatically empty cache when UCP status is changed only for the following plugins: W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, Endurance Page Cache, SiteGround SuperCacher and WP Fastest Cache.
